# This file defines the structure of the types which are automatically
# generated by dbus-interface-types.py. The overall structure is
# { structName: [member declaration, ...], ... }
#
# All structs are placed in the namespace QsdPrivate and accessible from
# #include "dbus-interface-types.h" within libqsystemd. The method
# QsdPrivate::registerMetaTypes() needs to be called before any DBus calls;
# this is done by the QsdManager ctor.
